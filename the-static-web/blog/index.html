			So, so you think you can tell
			Heaven from hell?
			Blue skies from pain?
			Can you tell a green field
			From a cold steel rail?
			A smile from a veil?
			Do you think you can tell?

			And did you think you could trade
			Your heroes for ghosts?
			Hot ashes for pain?
			Did you exchange
			...
			For a lead roll in a cage?

			How,
			How I wish you were here.
			We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,
			Year after year...
